## Overview
This portfolio is designed to highlight **Muhammad Hamza Sajid‚Äôs** expertise in creating cross-platform applications using technologies like **Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Ionic, and Electron**. It features a sleek **black-and-red theme**, dynamic animations, and a **responsive layout** for both desktop and mobile users.

## Features
- **Dynamic Content**: All content (name, titles, summary, skills, experience, projects, contact) is managed dynamically in TypeScript, making it easy to update.
- **Animated Background**:
  - A morphing hexagon shape that animates continuously using **Anime.js**.
  - A line drawing at the bottom of the screen with animated text (**"Innovative Web Solutions"**) using Anime.js.
- **Typing Effect**: Rotating titles (e.g., "Full-Stack Web Developer", "Cross-Platform Specialist", "Scalable Solutions Architect") with a blinking cursor in the Home section.
- **Sliding Content**: Sections slide in from the left or right when visible on scroll, enhancing user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile devices (below 768px), with adjusted padding, font sizes, and button layouts.
- **Project Buttons**: Each project includes **"Live Preview"** and **"GitHub Folder"** buttons linking to live demos and repositories.
- **Profile Picture**: Displays a circular profile picture in the Home section, styled with a **red border** and animated slide-in.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Scroll-based navigation with buttons to jump between sections (**Home, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact**), using **smooth scrolling**.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework**: Angular 19 (standalone components)
- **Animation Library**: Anime.js for morphing shapes, line drawings, typing effects, and sliding animations
- **Transition Library**: Barba.js for page-level transitions (though used minimally in this single-page layout)
- **Styling**: SCSS for responsive, theme-based styling (**black background, red accents**)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `@angular/core`, `@angular/common`, etc. (Angular 19 packages)
  - `animejs` for animations
  - `barba/core` for transitions
